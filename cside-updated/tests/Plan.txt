Plan for organizing the test files

Local Tasks
1. Local task create and calls
2. Multiple local task calls
3. Put local tasks on multiple executors - test with sleep - we should have concurrent exec_hist
4. Put local tasks and jsleep - we need to test for the accuracy of the jsleep

C->J Tasks
1. Launch C->J tasks with -- no results
2. Launch C->J tasks with -- results
3. Launch C->J tasks and test for timeout operation
4. Launch C->J tasks and see whether it goes to multiple levels
5. Launch C->J task and see whether it reaches different fogs we could have.
6. Selected operation at a particular level with JCond execution at the receiving node 

J->C Tasks
1. Launch J->C task with no results
2. Launch J->C tasks that have SYNC requirements - the schedule has a sync slot
3. Same as above with no SYNC slot - see whether we see any difference.
4. Launch J->C tasks that have REAL requirement with the schedule having a RT slot
5. Same as above with no REAL slot - see whether we see any difference

Combination of Tasks
1. J->C and C->J tasks going in loops 
2. J->C and C->J and Local tasks
