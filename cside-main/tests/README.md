# Tests

This folder contains various tests to be run as the main function of the ESP32. Some tests require more than 1 board. Outputs .txt files are present which can be used to compare the desired output. **Note**: The `OUTDATED` folder contains old tests which should not work due to refactoring/API change but are kept for record-keeping.
